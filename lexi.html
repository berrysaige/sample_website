Lexi loves horses and has a great past with a horse named hildago hopefully i
spelled that right.It's a great story and cute too.She has been a friend of mine
for quite a while now,and she is a very sweet person.Her and I spend a lot of
time together and we always have new adventures. She even said she could take me
 horse back riding sometime,I think that will be really fun.
